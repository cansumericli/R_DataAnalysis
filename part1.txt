Extract Transform Load (ETL) Paradigm
ETL is a framework for processing data and delivering it to an end user, who wants to consume data
in the form of business metrics ie) monthly sales, inventory forecasts, profit per user. Its important
because it provides a form of organizing a process, similar to an oil rig & pipeline, data needs to be
1) extracted 2) transformed-purified and cleaned if messy 3) loaded into trucks or tankers for future
consumers.
